# Server-Side Sorting
A Minecraft inventory sorting mod for Forge that works with vanilla clients.

Shift-right-click on an inventory slot to sort that inventory.
With a Forge client (even without the mod installed!), middle-clicking in survival mode also works.

When sorting the player inventory, the hotbar is not reorganized, but existing stacks are refilled.
This is done in the order: selected hotbar slot, offhand, rest of hotbar left-to-right.
